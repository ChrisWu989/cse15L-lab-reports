# Week 5 Lab Report
## less Command
The `less` command is a command line utility in linux that displays the contents of a file or command input, one page at a time. Compared to `vim` or `nano` the less command does not read the entire file but loads the file one page at a time which gives faster load speeds.

## less -m
* The command-line option -m, shows how much percentage of the file you have gone through. The percentage updates until you reach the end where it will be 100%

### Example 1

Input
```
cd 911report
less -m chapter-1.txt
```

Output ![image](screenshots/less_m1.png)
* Explanation: In this example we started in the techincal folder then went into the 911report folder to use the less -m command-line option on a file. In the screenshot there is a percentage at the bottom of the tile and it shows us how much of the file has been gone through. This is useful as it can tell the user where in the file they exactly are.

### Example 2

Input
```
cd biomed
less -m 1468-6708-3-1.txt
```

Output ![image](screenshots/less_m2.png)

### Example 3

```
cd plos
less -m journal.pbio.0020112.txt
```
Output ![image](screenshots/lessM3.png)
* Explanation: In this example we started in the techincal folder then went into the plos folder to use the less -m command-line option on a file.

## less -M
* The command-line option -M, is a more advanced version of the -m command-line option. In addition to showing the percentage like -m it also shows which lines you are looking at out of the total number of lines in the file.
